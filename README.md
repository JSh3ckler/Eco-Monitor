# Eco-Monitor
Do it yourself project from EECE 344 (Embedded Microcontrollers 2) at WWU.

I chose to accomplish this project by myself. I made what I consider to be a prototype plant incubator. I plan on flushing this project out for my final capstone project.

Included in this repository are the project guidelines, my full powerpoint and videos demonstraiting functionality.
